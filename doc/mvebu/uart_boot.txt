UART boot
=========

UART boot for Armada-70x0/80x0
------------------------------

UART boot is used to load flash-image.bin using the Xmodem interface
when the board boots for the first time or when the board fails to
boot.

1. Set the board to receiving mode using either of the following
   methods:

	- Start a terminal application (e.g. minicom), and send the
	  Xmodem_boot_pattern.bin file in ASCII (located under
          /tools/marvell/xmodem/xmodem_boot.pattern),
	  (for minicom do: Ctrl+A, then S, then select ASCII), and
	  reset the board at the same time.
	- This option is only relevant for Marvell development boards:
	  Set the boot source to UART, using boot source DIP-switch
	  pins, and then reset the board.

2. After booting from UART, or sending the pattern file, characters
   are displayed on the screen every second. These are the Xmodem
   NACKs that indicate readiness to send the new ATF with the Xmodem
   protocol.

3. Start the TTY transfer using the Xmodem protocol
   (for minicom do: Ctrl+A, then S, and select the Xmodem protocol).

4. Select flash-image.bin file, and start the transfer.

5. When the transfer is done, U-Boot will start and you should hit
   'return' to get the U-Boot prompt.

6. Refer to "doc/mvebu/cmd/bubt.txt" for instructions how to burn
   flash-image.bin to the boot device


UART boot for Armada-3700 platform
----------------------------------

Note that WtpDownload application (v3.3.11.15) is Linux host tool used
to do the UART boot. The source code and binaries is provided as part
of A3700 utility package, which is out of the bootloader source tree.
The package is located in same folder of the bootloader source. Please
refer to the readme.txt in wtptp_tool/src/Wtpdownloader_Linux folder
for the prerequisitions of the tool.

The following shows the detail steps of UART boot. The target board is
connected to /dev/ttyUSB0 in this example, replace the port number
according to your set-up.

1. The normal ATF build procedure for A3700 target creates a folder
   with all the images required for UART boot under ATF build output
   folder (build/a3700/). Make sure u-boot was built before ATF, see
   detail in build.txt.

2. Make sure the target board is in UART mode and ">" prompt is
   presented on the connected terminal. Pressing "Enter" in this mode
   will show "E" and then ">" again.
   There is a way to stop the target board booting from other sources,
   SPI flash for example, and switch to UART boot mode, by using the
   WtpDownload application::

	sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 clocal
	./WtpDownload_linux -P UART -C 0 -R 115200 -Y

3. Stop the terminal emulator program on the UART port attached to the
   target board (minicom) for releasing the serial port and allowing
   an application to use it for image download.

4. Disable the TTY modem control signals::

	sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 clocal

5. Start the image download application in the ATF build folder using
   the following parameters.

   WTP downloader usage example - non-secure boot::

	./WtpDownload_linux -P UART -C 0 -R 115200 \
		-B ./uart-images/TIM_ATF.bin \
		-I ./uart-images/boot-image_h.bin \
		-I ./uart-images/wtmi_h.bin -E

   WTP downloader usage example - secure boot::

	./WtpDownload_linux -P UART -C 0 -R 115200 \
		-B ./uart-images/TIM_ATF_TRUSTED.bin \
		-B ./uart-images/TIMN_ATF_TRUSTED.bin \
		-I ./uart-images/boot-image_h.bin \
		-I ./uart-images/wtmi_h.bin -E

   Note that "-E" parameter can be dropped from the above commands.
   If you do this, check that the BootROM UART download mode is
   selected in paragraph 2, type in terminal "wtp" without quotes and
   press Enter. Then follow the procedure described in paragraph 3.
   This command will switch the BootROM to WTP download mode. The same is
   archieved by "-E" parameter in latest downloader SW.

6. After the process is finished, start the terminal emulator
   program (minicom) on that the UART port attached to the target
   board and ensure the U-Boot prompt is reached.

Note that steps 2-5 can be simplified with a single command as below::

	sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 clocal
	./WtpDownload_linux -P UART -C 0 -R 115200 \
		-B ./uart-images/TIM_ATF.bin \
		-I ./uart-images/boot-image_h.bin \
		-I ./uart-images/wtmi_h.bin -E -O
