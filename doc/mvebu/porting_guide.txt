U-Boot Porting Guide
====================

This document provide instructions for porting the Marvell U-Boot package to a customer board.

Relevant Devices
----------------
- Armada-80x0
- Armada-70x0
- Armada-37x0

Introduction
------------
	U-Boot configuration is based on three elements:

	- defconfig file:
	  This file includes compile-time options for U-Boot, and is used to
	  enable / disable U-Boot device drivers and features.
	- include/configs/mv-common.h, include/configs/mvebu_<soc-name>.h (e.g. armada8k.h)
	  These files include low-level control over U-Boot definitions,
	  and is likely not to be changed when porting to a new board.
	- device-tree files
	  These files are located under arch/arm/dts, and include the runtime
	  configuration of U-Boot, and enables passing configuration parameters for
	  each of the drivers/units in U-Boot.
	  The majority of the porting should be done in the device-tree.
	  For more information about device-tree syntax, refer to the various examples
	  under arch/arm/dts/ or visit http://devicetree.org/Device_Tree_Usage

	For the sake of simplicity, all examples below will use the armada-80x0-db board, and the new
	board will be called "my_board".


Customer Board Porting Procedure
--------------------------------

defconfig & DT file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   1. defconfig

	- Find the defconfig file that matches the SoC flavor being used (e.g. armada-3700, armada-70x0...)
	- Create a new defconfig to hold U-Boot compile time configuration::

		> cp configs/mvebu_db_armada8k_defconfig configs/my_board_defconfig

   2. device-tree

	- Create a new DT file to hold U-Boot runtime configuration for your board.
	- Some example DT files already exist in U-Boot, it's possible to use them as-is or
	  rename to match your system's name::

		> cp arch/arm/dts/armada-8040-db.dts arch/arm/dts/armada-70x0-my_board.dts

	- Add new DT file to arch/arm/dts/Makefile under CONFIG_ARCH_MVEBU::

		dtb-$(CONFIG_ARCH_MVEBU) +=                     \
			armada-70x0-my_board.dtb                \
			armada-3720-db.dtb                      \

Basic defconfig setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   1. Update my_board defconfig::

		> make my_board_defconfig
		> make menuconfig

	- Update device tree file name:
		-> Device Tree Control -> Default Device Tree for DT control -> "armada-80x0-my_board"

	- Save and exit::

		> make savedefconfig
		> cp defconfig configs/my_board_defconfig

   2. Compilation sanity

      Compile U-Boot to make sure that everything was set properly.
      (Refer to doc/mvebu/build.txt for detailed build instructions)::

		> export CROSS_COMPILE=/path/to/toolchain/aarch64-linux-gnu
		> make

You are ready to start porting U-Boot to match "my_board" configuration.


Device-tree porting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This is the actual porting of U-Boot to make it work properly on "my_board":

	- Edit the "my_board" dts file under arch/arm/dts/<name of dts given in section 2 above>
	- For each of the (configurable) U-Boot drivers/units, a device tree binding
	  description file exists, which explains the different configuration options
	  for the relevant driver.

   Below is a list of drivers/units, and their relevant DT binding description file:
   (all file paths are relative to "doc/device-tree-bindings/")
