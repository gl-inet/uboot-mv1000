EFUSE (burn/read efuse value) commands for A7K/8K and A38x SoCs:
--------------------------------------
Efuse command is used to burn efuse value to chip efuse block or read
efuse values.

The efuse command gets the following parameters: bank, word, count, hexval.
fuse sense/overide are not supported for Marvell SoCs chips.

bank	- efuse row line ID.
word	- starting word for each efuse row, each word contains 32 bits.
count	- amount of words shown by read command. Default is 1.
hexval	- new efuse value to be programmed

Example:
---------
fuse read <bank> <word> [<count>] - read 1 or 'count' fuse words,
    starting at 'word'
fuse prog [-y] <bank> <word> <hexval> [<hexval>...] - program 1 or
    several fuse words, starting at 'word' (permanent change)

efuse command details (read/burn step by-step)
----------------------------------------------
This section describes efuse command flow:
Efuse Read/prog are supported using a single command or multiple commands.
For efuse HD row(65 bits length), count must be less than 2. However, efuse LD
row's(256 bits length) count is less than 8. Besides, only HD efuse has a lock
bit.

See the efuse reading/programming example for A8K device below.
Read efuse line ID == 32's entire row value.
	a. single command:
		fuse read 32 0 2	- efuse line ID 32's whole 65 bits(bit0~64).
	b. multiple commands:
		fuse read 32 0		- read HD efuse line ID bits from 0 to 31.
		fuse read 32 1		- read HD efuse line ID bits from 32 to 63.
		fuse read 32 2		- read HD efuse line ID bit 64(lock bit).


Prog/burn efuse value to the whole efuse row (Line ID == 32).
	a. single command:
		fuse prog -y 32 0 0x12030412 0x00234532 0x1	- prog new efuse value to
						the whole efuse row.
	b. multiple commands:
		fuse prog -y 32 0 0x12030412	- prog/burn 0x12030412 to HD efuse
						row's bits from 0 to 31.
		fuse prog -y 32 1 0x00234532	- prog/burn 0x00234532 to HD efuse
						row's bits from 32 to 63.
		fuse prog -y 32 2 0x1		- prog/burn 0x1(lock bit) to LD efuse
						row's bit64.

HD efuse supports independent programming of the row lock bit. For such case
efuse row bits 0 through 63 will be zeroed.
	c. fuse prog -y 32 2 0x1		- Only prog lock bit for HD efuse row.
