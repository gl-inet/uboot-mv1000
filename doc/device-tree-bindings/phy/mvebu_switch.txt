SOHO Switch Support with SOC
----------------------------

Overview
========
Marvell SOHO switch can be integrated to work with ARMADA 7K/8k/37xx SoC
devices. This doc corresponds to mv88e6xxx driver which adds basic support
for peridot and topaz switches i.e. 88E6390/88E6290/88E6190 and
88E6341/88E6141 switches.

SOHO switch is connected to SOC through smi interface. When the mv88e6xxx is
hardware configured to have smi address zero, it behaves in single-chip
addressing mode. Otherwise it behaves in multi-chip addressing mode.
In single chip addressing mode, switch registers can be accessed directly with
mdio_read/mdio_write functions. When the chip is configured to a non-zero
address, it only responds to that SMI address and requires indirect writes
through smi command and smi data registers of the switch to access the
different device addresses.

SOHO switches has phys integrated inside the chip. Registers of the internal
phys can only be accessed indirectly through switch registers (smi phy command
and smi phy data registers).

mv88e6xxx driver
=================
mv88e6xxx driver reads the device tree for parameters like smi address,
cpu port, portmask etc. and initializes switch devices structures. It adds an
uboot command "switch" which provides utility functions to get switch
information, read/write switch or internal phy registers, get link status.

The definition "CONFIG_MV88E6XXX_SWITCH=y" must be present in the config
file to enable the switch driver or switch command.

Sample device tree modification
===============================
Hardware:
- Armada 7040 development board i.e. PCB: DB-88F7040-Modular
- SOHO switch (88E6390) module i.e. PCB: DB-A8k-SWITCH-MODULE

Device tree modification:
Add below node inside mdio node in dts file.

&cpm_mdio {
	mvswitch: switch@0{
		compatible = "marvell,mv88e6xxx";
		status = "okay";
		phy-addr = <3>;
		cpu-port = <0x0>;
		port-mask = <0x3ff>;
	};
};

Mandatory properties:

compatible - "marvell,mv88e6xxx" for peridot (MV88E6190/6290/6390) and
	     topaz SOHO family of switches.
phy-addr   - smi address. 0 for direct addressing, non-zero of indirect
             addressing mode.
cpu-port   - cpu port. Default port 0 is used as cpu port.
port-mask  - port mask specified number of valid/usable ports on the
	     board.
