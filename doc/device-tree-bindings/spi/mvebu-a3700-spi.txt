Marvell Armada3700 SPI bindings
====================

This SPI driver supports Marvell Armada3700 SoC, which implements the SPI core operations.
The node name is spi0 to show that it's SPI-0, for SPI-1 it should be spi1.

The SPI node for Armada3700 requires the following properties:
SoC specific:
	- compatible: Should be "marvell,armada-3700-spi".
	- reg: The base address of the SPI unit.
	- spi-max-frequency: SPI max bus frequency.
	- clock-frequency: The input clock for the SPI interface.

Example for SPI-0 node:
	spi0: spi@10600 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-spi";
		reg = <0x10600 0x50>;
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-frequency = <160000>;
		spi-max-frequency = <40000>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
