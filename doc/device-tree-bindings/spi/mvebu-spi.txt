Marvell SPI binding
===================

Binding for SPI Driver Marvell's Armada familiy SoCs (Apart from A37x0).

Mandatory properties:
SoC specific:
- compatible: 		Should be one of the following options:
				"marvell,armada-375-spi"
				"marvell,armada-380-spi"
				"marvell,armada-xp-spi"
- reg:			Base address of SPI host controllers
- clocks:		This property points to the used clock for the SPI interface.
- cell-index:		SPI unit id.
- #address-cells: 	Must be <1>, as required by generic SPI binding.
- #size-cells:		Must be <0>, also as required by generic SPI binding.


Board specific:
- spi-max-frequency:	SPI max bus frequency.

Example: For SPI-0 node:
	cpm_spi0: spi@700600 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-380-spi";
			reg = <0x700600 0x50>;
			#address-cells = <0x1>;
			#size-cells = <0x0>;
			cell-index = <1>;
			clocks = <&cpm_syscon0 0 3>;
	};
