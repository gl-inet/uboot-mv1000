SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) busses

SCSI busses can be described with a node for the SCSI controller device
and a set of child nodes for each SCSI devices on the bus. An SCSI controller
node can also be a Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) controller, which can act as an
add-on host bus adapter or work as a pure controller as an on-board component
on the motherboard, to offer compatibility with SATA devices.

The SCSI controller node requires the following properties:
- #address-cells  - the number of cells used to represent physical base addresses
- #size-cells     - the number of cells used to represent the size of an address
- compatible      - the name of SCSI bus controller following generic names recommended practice

No other properties are required in the SCSI bus node.  It is assumed
that a driver for an SCSI bus device will understand that it is an SCSI bus.

Optional property:
- base            - scsi register base address
- max-id          - maximum number of scsi target ids, the default value is CONFIG_SYS_SCSI_MAX_SCSI_ID
- max-lun         - maximum number of scsi logical units, the default value is CONFIG_SYS_SCSI_MAX_LUN

SCSI device nodes must be children of the SCSI controller node, for example, in "marvell,mvebu-scsi.txt",
the SCSI device node "sata" is the child of the SCSI controller node "scsi".
