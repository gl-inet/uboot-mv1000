Binding for marvell mvebu SCSI controller

Required properties:
- #address-cells  - Number of cells used to represent physical base addresses
- #size-cells     - Number of cells used to represent the size of an address
- compatible      - Name of mvebu SCSI bus controller, supported value "marvell,mvebu-scsi".
                    Covers the following Marvell SoC families: armada3700, armada70x0 and armada80x0

Optional property:
- max-id          - Maximum number of SCSI target IDs, the default value is CONFIG_SYS_SCSI_MAX_SCSI_ID
- max-lun         - maximum number of SCSI logical units, the default value is CONFIG_SYS_SCSI_MAX_LUN


Examples of SCSI controller which is SAS and acts as an add-on host
bus adapter without the base register.

Armada37x0:
	- Has only 1 SATA interface, so the property "max-id" is 1;
	- Max logical units number is 1, so the property "max-lun" is 1.

	scsi: scsi {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-scsi";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		max-id = <1>;
		max-lun = <1>;
		sata: sata@e0000 {
			compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-ahci";
			reg = <0xe0000 0x2000>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 27 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		};
	};

Armada80x0:
	- Has 2 SATA interface, so the property "max-id" is 2;
        - Max logical units number is 1, so the property "max-lun" is 1.

	cpm_scsi: scsi_0 {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-scsi";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		max-id = <2>;
		max-lun = <1>;
		status = "disabled";
		cpm_sata0: sata@540000 {
			compatible = "marvell,armada-8k-ahci";
			reg = <0x540000 0x30000>;
		};
	};
