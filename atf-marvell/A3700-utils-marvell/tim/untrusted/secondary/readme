The file tim.txt/img-1.txt/img-2.txt kept in the directory are used to build the secondary flash-image.
The secondary image is supposed to be burned at SPI flash on its 2Mbyte offset. If the bootROM detects
the primary image at offset 0x0 on the SPI flash is corrupted, it will try to pick up the secondary boot
image at the 2Mbyte offset.

To build the secondary image, please replace the tim.txt/img-1.txt/img-2.txt under the directory of
tools/wtp/untrusted with the ones in this directory and rebuild your flash-image.bin.

To burn the secondary flash-image.bin, you will not be ablel to use the bubt tool which burns the image
at offset 0x0. Instead please use the sf update command to burn the image:

   1. Load the image to memory
	tftp 0x2000000 flash-image.bin.secondary
   2. Burn the image to flash
	sf probe
	sf update 0x2000000   0x200000    0x100000
                    |            |           |
                  mem addr   spi offset   image size

To confirm the secondary boot image is working fine - just for the testing purpose, you can corrupt
the first boot image on the SPI by doing:

    sf probe
    sf erase 0x0 0x100000  ;erase the first 1MB of the SPI flash

Then reboot the system, you'll find the system still boots sucessfully - by picking up the boot image
at 2MB offset from the SPI flash.
